# DPKI

Components of DPKI:

1. Decentralized identity management: A system for creating, managing, and authenticating decentralized identities (DIDs) without relying on centralized authorities.

2. Distributed storage: Utilizing distributed ledger technology (DLT) or peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for storing public keys and associated metadata.

3. Trust model: Establishing trust between parties through a web of trust, where users vouch for each other's keys, or a trustless model based on cryptographic proofs.

4. Key validation and revocation: Mechanisms for verifying the authenticity, integrity, and validity of public keys, as well as the ability to revoke compromised keys.

5. Secure communication: End-to-end encrypted communication channels between users, leveraging public key cryptography for encryption and authentication.

6. Privacy-preserving techniques: Ensuring user privacy through techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, and metadata protection.

7. Interoperability: Enabling seamless integration and communication between different DPKI systems and protocols.

8. Scalability and performance: Optimizing DPKI systems to handle large numbers of users and transactions without compromising security or decentralization.

9. User interfaces and tooling: Developing user-friendly interfaces, libraries, and tools to facilitate the adoption and use of DPKI systems by developers and end-users.
